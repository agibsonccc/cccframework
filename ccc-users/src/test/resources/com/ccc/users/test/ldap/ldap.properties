#The search filter is the query string. It is used to filter the entries in the directory and produce the desired set 
#of matching records. Filters are built using parentheses and combinations of the symbols &, |, and !, 
#which represent AND, OR and NOT, respectively. If you wanted to locate all people with "jhunter" at 
#the beginning of their names, the following filter would do the trick:
#(&(objectclass=person)(cn=jhunter*))
